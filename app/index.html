         The React app renders into this container.
         As rendering into the document.body is a bad idea.
         warning logged by React is:
         Rendering components directly into document.body is discouraged,
         since its children are often manipulated by third-party scripts and browser extensions.
         This may lead to subtle reconciliation issues.
         Try rendering into a container element created for your app.

         Magic!
         All assets (js and css) are injected by html-webpack-plugin automatically,
         which is why they are missing here.
         Do not add any assets here!
